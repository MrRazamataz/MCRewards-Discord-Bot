# MCRewards-Discord-Bot
A Discord bot that rewards players in Minecraft for sending messages on Discord


## How to setup:
* Download this git as a .zip, or clone it.
* Install the pip packages in `requirements.txt` with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3` depening on how your system is setup.
* Go to `config.json` and fill out the needed info.
* Start the bot with `main.py`.
* Your users must link their Discord account to their Minecraft account with the `mcr!link <username>` command. Eg: `mcr!link MrRazamataz`. They will be reminded to link if they haven't every time they level up, otherwise the rewards won't work.
